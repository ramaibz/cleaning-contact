# cleaning-contact
<h2>Case study</h2>
I've been given a task to import contacts data from FileMaker format (.fp7) to newest system, which has unnormalized data.
So, i made this <b>dirty</b> and not-so-DRY program to help me migrate thousand records data, normalized them so it matched the data design made in the newest Filemaker system.
